Frame v0.7.0 Documentation
=======================================================
Welcome! Here you will find the official v0.7.0 documentation for the **Frame Software Architecture Language**. 

What is Frame?
--------------
Frame is a simple yet powerful textual language for defining the dynamic behavior of systems. With Frame notation it is easy to quickly design state machines that comply with core UML statechart concepts through a decidedly advantageous new approach.

A Markdown Language For System Designers
----------------------------------------

UML and other modeling specifications promote a visual-first paradigm. However this approach to system design requires (sometimes expensive) diagramming and modeling tools. Additionally - letâ€™s just say it - working with boxes and lines to code can be a pain when the systems get complex.

With Frame, anyone with a text editor can quickly sketch out a system design concept - notepad is just fine!
