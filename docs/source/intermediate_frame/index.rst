Intermediate Frame
==================

Frame's syntax supports concepts from Statecharts, a state machine visual
language invented by Dr David Harel in his
1987 paper . Statechart notation is used in both UML software
modeling and the SYSML systems modeling languages as the standard flavor of
state machine visual languages.

Although Frame has some deviations from a strict interpretation
of some of the more complex aspects of the Statechart semantics, these
differences enable a simplfied implemenation of the generated controller code
as well as enable new capabilities
not addressed in Statecharts. These advanced features will be discussed in
detail in the advanced section.
